To utilize Windows 11's modern text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities in PowerShell, especially the high-quality neural voices like "Microsoft Aria (Natural)", you'll need to leverage the Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs.  These voices are accessible through the Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer class, not via the older System.Speech.Synthesis namespace. 

Prerequisites

1. PowerShell 7 or higher: Required for compatibility with WinRT APIs. 


2. Windows 11 with Neural Voices Installed: Ensure that neural voices are installed on your system. You can add them via:

Settings > Accessibility > Narrator > Add natural voices 



3. Windows SDK Installed: The necessary WinRT assemblies are typically included with Windows 11. However, if you encounter issues, installing the Windows 10/11 SDK can help. 



PowerShell Script to Use Neural Voices

Here's a PowerShell 7 script that lists available voices and speaks a sample text using a neural voice: 

# Load the WinRT bridge assembly
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime

# Define the SpeechSynthesizer class from WinRT
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @"
using System;
using Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis;

public static class SpeechHelper
{
    public static SpeechSynthesizer GetSynthesizer()
    {
        return new SpeechSynthesizer();
    }
}
"@ -Language CSharp

# Instantiate the SpeechSynthesizer
$synth = [SpeechHelper]::GetSynthesizer()

# List all available voices
$voices = $synth.AllVoices
$voices | ForEach-Object { $_.DisplayName }

# Select a neural voice (e.g., "Microsoft Aria (Natural)")
$voice = $voices | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*Aria*" } | Select-Object -First 1
if ($voice) {
    $synth.Voice = $voice
} else {
    Write-Host "Desired voice not found. Using default voice."
}

# Synthesize the text to a stream
$stream = $synth.SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync("Hello from PowerShell using a neural voice.").GetAwaiter().GetResult()

# Convert the stream to a .NET stream
$netStream = [System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions]::AsStreamForRead($stream)

# Play the audio
$player = New-Object System.Media.SoundPlayer $netStream
$player.PlaySync()

Notes:

This script uses a C# helper class to instantiate the SpeechSynthesizer due to limitations in directly accessing WinRT classes from PowerShell. 

Ensure that the desired neural voice (e.g., "Microsoft Aria (Natural)") is installed on your system. 

The SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync method is asynchronous; hence, .GetAwaiter().GetResult() is used to synchronously wait for the result.
